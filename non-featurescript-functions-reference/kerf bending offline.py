#Kerf bending parabolas, Michael Schiebler 2-4-25

"""ABSTRACT:
Kerf bending is a technique in which cuts (kerfs) are made partway through a material, typically plywood, to create a flexible hinge point,
allowing flat panels to be bent into curved surfaces.

Typically equally spaced lines are used, which result in the curves being arcs.

The algorithm implemented here computes the points at which to cut in order to obtain a kerf bent piece that follows the curve chosen. Cuts should be made exactly on
the lines outputted (without tool correction)

# USER INPUT:

# CURVE DEFINITION
#these points act as control points of a quadratic bezier curve, which happens to be a portion of parabola
Cpoints = [(-400,0,0),(0,-820,0),(400,0,0)]

# MATERIAL AND TOOL INFO
#all dimensions in mm 

cut_width = 2.7   #thickness of the blade

cut_depth = 35  #ideally about  10–15% less than the thickness of your plywood, make sure to test it IRL beforehand.
                #Better approximations are obtained with deeper cut depths (thicker plywood) and thinner blades, this decreases the kerf angle and increase the amount of cuts needed
                #to conform to a given curve.

# OUTPUT PREFERENCES
line_length = 80   #the lenght of each line representing a cut

base_name = "kerf_dxf"  #default name with which the dxf file gets saved

display_extra_geometries = True   #draw all the extra stuff that isn't the lines needed for CAM. Namely the curve being traced and construction lines.
                                  #This will also help show the theory behind the algorithm and debug if needed.

# SYSTEM VARIABLES
Csamples= 1000  #number of samples taken along the bezier curve, keep it even!!, proportional to computational complexity
 
start_dxf = True  #whether or not to automatically open the output dxf (uses your default software)

start_dir = True  #automatically open the directory in which the file is located
